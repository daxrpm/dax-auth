# DaxAuth - PAM-FaceAuthentication

DaxAuth is a project that provides facial authentication for Linux systems using PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules). This project is currently under development and may have some security risks, such as the potential to unlock with photos, also actually tested for some months it seems to have problems working in dark spaces

DaxAuth can be integrated in any system that uses PAM as authentication

sudo dnf install -y cmake make gcc gcc-c++ python3 python3-devel python3-pip pam-devel
```

##### For Arch-based systems (using `pacman`)

```sh
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm cmake make gcc python python-pip python-virtualenv pam
```


#### Create necessary directories

sudo mkdir -p /opt/daxauth
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/daxauth/data
```

#### Create and activate a Python virtual environment

```sh
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/daxauth/.venv
source /opt/daxauth/.venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install required Python packages

```sh
sudo /opt/daxauth/.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Copy source and configuration files

```sh
sudo cp -r src /opt/daxauth
sudo cp -r config /opt/daxauth
```

#### Copy the main script to `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable

```sh
sudo cp src/daxauth /usr/local/bin/daxauth
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/daxauth
```

#### Compile the C code for the PAM module

```sh
cd /opt/daxauth/src/pam
sudo make
```

#### Copy the compiled PAM module to the appropriate directory

The directory may change based on your distro

```sh
sudo cp pam_face_auth.so /lib/security
```

#### Backup the existing sudo PAM configuration file

```sh
sudo cp /etc/pam.d/sudo /etc/pam.d/sudo.bak
```

#### Modify the sudo PAM configuration to include the new module in sudo auth

You can add it too all the modules you want to work with

```sh
sudo grep -qF "auth sufficient pam_face_auth.so" /etc/pam.d/sudo || sudo sed -i '1a auth sufficient pam_face_auth.so' /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

## Usage CLI

### Commands

#### Register a New Face

To register a new face, use the `add` command. This command requires superuser privileges.

```sh
sudo daxauth add
```

This will prompt you to provide the necessary images for face registration.

#### Clear Face Encodings and Register Images

To clear all face encodings and registered images, use the `clear` command. This command also requires superuser privileges.

```sh
sudo daxauth clear
```

This will delete all stored face encodings and registered images.
